# Countdown_screen

Countdown screen project: This is a personal project developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The objective of this project is to create a countdown timer with an audible alert upon selecting a specific date and time. The project was designed and developed with a focus on accessibility, allowing users to change the system theme. For instance, it starts with a dark theme, but users have the option to switch to a light theme based on their preference.

**Note:** This project may receive future updates, including the addition of a display for days. In other words, apart from counting hours, it could also show the number of days remaining.
